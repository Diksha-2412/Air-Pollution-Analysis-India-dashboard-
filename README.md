# Air-Pollution-Analysis-India-dashboard-
Power BI dashboard analyzing air pollution levels across Indian states and cities using pollutant-wise data, geographical mapping, and interactive visualizations.

🌍 Air Pollution Analysis Dashboard – India
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes air pollution trends across India. The dashboard provides insights into pollutant distribution, state-wise and city-wise pollution levels, and geographical patterns using map-based visualization.

📊 Key Objectives
Analyze air pollution data across Indian states and major cities
Identify dominant pollutants affecting air quality
Compare pollution levels state-wise and city-wise
Visualize geographic distribution of pollution using latitude and longitude

🔍 Key Features
Pollutant-wise Analysis: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, Ozone, SO2, NH3
State-wise Distribution: Pollution count comparison across Indian states
City-level Insights: Top polluted cities based on pollutant averages
Geographical Mapping: Latitude–longitude based pollution visualization
Interactive Filters: Pollutant selection using slicers
Clean & Intuitive Dashboard Design
